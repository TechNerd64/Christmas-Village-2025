# Christmas-Village-2025
Every year I build a christmas village out of everything from Legos to ceramic houses.  This year I want to incorperate moving and more visual elements using Arduino.  I have both an Arduino UNO and MEGA 2560, but I'll likely use the MEGA as my primary microcontroller.  Then I'll reserve the UNO for the second smaller part of the village.
